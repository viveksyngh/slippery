**Slippery** - collections of useful decorators for performance checking, profiling, disassembling, pretty output of data structures and more.

Your code seems to work slowly and you haven't got any idea why it happens 
and how to solve it? 

A function returns crazily structured data and you can't find what you need? 

So, Slippery Stair help with all these problems and some more. 
Just decorate functions you need to take a second look at and see what happens!

## Installation

```
âžœ  pip install slippery
```

## Usage

To use this library you need to pay 25 schmeckles.

```bash
export SCHMECKLES=25
```

<sub>You can actually use it without paying any schmeckles, but... come on! 
Only 25 schmeckles for Slippery Stair? That's a bargain!


## Now, seriously

Sometime we need to check out the execution time of some function. 
Here's a useless function for example:

```python
import slippery

@slippery.execution_time
def generator(no=True, maximum=100, registry=None):
    if no:
        do_something()

    if not registry:
        update_something()

    result = [
        k for k in [
            i for i in range(maximum)
        ]
    ]

    return result
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    generator(True, 100, [1, 2, 3])
```
Result:

When you need more information than the one returned from the `@execution_time` decorator you should use the `@efficiency` decorator:

```python
@slippery.efficiency
def generator(*args, **kwargs):
    # ...

```

Result:

![](media/efficiency_screen.png)


You can also disassemble the function using the `@disassemble` decorator:

```python
@slippery.disassemble
def generator(maximum=1000):
    result = [
        k for k in [
            i for i in range(20)
        ]
    ]
    result.append([x for x in 'SMAP'])

    return result	
```
Result:

## Disclaimer
Slippery is developed only for developers and only for debugging and testing phases. This library should not used in production, if you don't want unacceptable behaviour of your application.

## Thanks

This library is originally inspired by the character *Slippery Stair* from `Rick and Morty`. Special thanks for `Mark Lutz` and `Luciano Romalho` for great books about Python.
